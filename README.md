# README #

I have used PHP, Eclipse IDE and WAMP for the dev as these are the tools I am most familiar with. 
The approach I have taken is OOP in a MCV design pattern.
Although it may of been quicker writing the code procedurally, 
I have tried to keep the MVC structure simple allowing it to be scalable, reuseable and modular.
The code is commented throughout.
Enjoy.

# TODO #

1. Better validation
2. Unit tests
